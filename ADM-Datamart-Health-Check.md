Many of the plot functions from the CDH Tools library are put together in a single R notebook that performs a standard analysis of the models, propositions and predictors from the ADM datamart.

This notebook delivers some quick insights and typically leads to some follow up questions with the business owners.

Although the notebook is in R, it does not require any R skills to run this. It is just a tool and does not require any programming skills in R to be used.
