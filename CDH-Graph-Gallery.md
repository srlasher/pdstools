Welcome to the CDH graph gallery, a collection of charts made from Pega data to give you insights into CDH.

The charts are made using just a few lines of R or Python and use data from the ADM Datamart, from IH and Decision Results. A few also use customer data exports. The gallery intends to show how easy it is to get additional and deeper insights into the what and how of CDH and the AI models mostly using stock data exports from the platform.

It is by no means exhaustive but mainly serves to give inspiration and some guidance how to use the open source GitHub repository with CDH tools.
