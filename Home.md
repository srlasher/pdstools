# Welcome to the cdh-datascientist-tools wiki!

These open sourced accompanying tools to Pega CDH (Customer Decision Hub) provide data scientists some tooling to analyze the data produced by a running Pega Decisioning system. It includes tools to easily read Dataset exports, convert Adaptive Models to scorecards, off-line browsable reports on the adaptive models and more. 

Tooling is both in R and Python although currently not everything is available in both languages.
